Python interface to MySQL
=========================

MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL_ database server for
Python.  The design goals are:

- Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]_

- Thread-safety

- Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other) 

MySQL-3.22 through 4.1 and Python-2.3 through 2.4 are currently
supported.

MySQLdb is `Free Software`_.
